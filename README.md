# Flutter ClipRect Widget Demo

A Flutter demonstration app showcasing the **ClipRect** widget through an interactive tap-to-focus photo viewer and clipping types comparison interface.

## 🧩 Widget Description

The `ClipRect` widget clips its child to a rectangular boundary, preventing any overflow and allowing precise control over which portions of a widget are visible. Any part of the child outside this rectangle is not rendered

## 📱 Demo Overview

This app demonstrates ClipRect through two interactive screens:

1. **Tap & Focus Demo** - An interactive photo viewer where tapping any area creates a focused ClipRect window while blurring the background, simulating magnification or detail inspection features found in photo editing and AR apps.

2. **Clipping Types Comparison** - A carousel demonstrating ClipRect alongside ClipRRect, ClipOval, and ClipPath, with live sliders to adjust clipping parameters in real-time.

## 🎯 Real-World Use Case

**Scenario:** Photo editing and product preview applications

Users often need to isolate and inspect specific regions of an image. This demo simulates a tap-to-focus feature where:
- Users tap anywhere on an image
- The selected region is highlighted with ClipRect
- The rest of the image blurs, drawing attention to the focused area
- Smooth animations enhance the user experience

Similar functionality appears in:
- Photo editing apps (crop preview, detail inspection)
- E-commerce product viewers (zoom to see texture/details)
- Medical imaging applications (focus on specific regions)
- AR interfaces (isolate objects for analysis)

## 🔑 Three Key Attributes

| Attribute | Description | Demonstration in Code |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------|
| **`child`** | The widget being clipped. ClipRect restricts this child to only display within the rectangular bounds. | In our code, an `Image.asset` serves as the child, and only the selected rectangular area remains visible while the rest is hidden. |
| **`clipBehavior`** | Controls the quality of the clipping edges. Options include `Clip.hardEdge` (fast), `Clip.antiAlias` (smooth), `Clip.antiAliasWithSaveLayer` (highest quality), or `Clip.none`. | We use `Clip.antiAlias` for smooth edges when the focused area zooms in, balancing performance with visual quality. |
| **`Align` with `widthFactor` / `heightFactor`** | While not directly part of ClipRect, the `Align` widget is commonly used with ClipRect to control what portion of the child is visible. Values range from 0.0 (fully clipped) to 1.0 (fully visible). | The slider in the Clipping Types Demo adjusts these factors dynamically, letting users see more or less of the image in real-time. |

### Code Example
```dart
ClipRect(
  clipBehavior: Clip.antiAlias,     // Smooth clipping edges
  child: Align(
    alignment: Alignment.center,    // Center the content
    widthFactor: clipFactor,        // Controls horizontal clipping (0.0-1.0)
    heightFactor: clipFactor,       // Controls vertical clipping (0.0-1.0)
    child: imageWidget,             // The child being clipped
  ),
)
```

**Location in code:** `lib/main.dart` → `ClipImageCard` class → `_buildClippedImage()` method → `case 'ClipRect':`
